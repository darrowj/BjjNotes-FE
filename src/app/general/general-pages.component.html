    <p id="aboutus-head" class="about center-block">About</p>
    <p>When you start Jiu Jitsu you are a white belt, colorless, blank and without experience.
    The first day on the matt you look around and see people doing things that look easy.  That is of course until you try and do them yourself.
    You roll and realize you have no idea what you are doing.  The people around you with colored belts seem
    to be doing things that are superhuman.  They have instincts and vision into reactions thier opponents that seems improbable.
    It is overwhelming on many different levels: physically, mentally, emotionally and to some spiritually (yeah seriously).
    </p>
    <p>If you decide to coutinue the journey it will not be easy.  It takes between 7 and 10 years to get a belt belt.
      So don't even think about it.  Just show up... every week and train.  The quote "Suffer the discipline now or the regrets later"
    applies here.  There is no other substitute than getting out on the matt.  No amount of book study or video watching will replace it.
    Get up and get after it or regret not being a part of it.</p>
    <p>This site is meant to capture little pieces of a session on the matt, from a roll or a class, that you do not want to forget.</p>
